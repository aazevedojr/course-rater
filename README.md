# course-rater
*Designed to assist Super Mario Maker players to rate and give feedback to each other*

Me and my friends always throw Super Mario Maker competitions.
We each design a course according to a theme given by the last competition's winner and then vote on the best ones to decide the next winner.
Whenever a new course is uploaded, that course can be accesses by a unique code such as "C2D1-0000-0337-91A4".
Super Mario Maker offers a database search platform to share finished courses across the world: https://supermariomakerbookmark.nintendo.net
This program retrieves data directly from that database to register courses for a specific competition and allows users to tell rather they liked the course they played or not.
